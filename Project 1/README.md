# PROJECT 1 DOCUMENTATION 

# Packages 
I imported pandas, requests, and json

# Fetching my API data 
This is the API I used: https://coronavirus.m.pipedream.net/
This pulls current Covid cases and deaths numbers from a Johns Hopkins University database.

# Data Transformation
I simplified the data to just the global rates of cases and deaths, and then added a column to calculate current death rate from Covid cases around the world.
